NAIS Java baseimage
=====================

Basic Usage
---------------------

We support one way of running your app:
1. A fat jar called `app.jar`

Create a `Dockerfile` containing:

### Simplest example
The simplest way of running your app is to create a far jar and copy it into your container as `app.jar`.
Since the default working directory is `/app`, there's no need to specify the path.

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/navikt/fp-baseimages/java:<version>
COPY target/my-awesome.jar app.jar
```

## Customisation

Custom runtime options may be specified using the environment variable `JAVA_OPTS`.

### Start up scripts

You can add custom behavior to your container by copying `.sh` files
to the `/init-scripts` dir. The files are sourced which means that
you can export environment variables or extend the existing ones like `JAVA_OPTS`.

```sh
# copy into the container as /run-java.sh
exec java ${DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS} ${JAVA_OPTS} -jar app.jar ${RUNTIME_OPTS} $@
```

We highly recommend that you write your app so that you don't need this feature.
